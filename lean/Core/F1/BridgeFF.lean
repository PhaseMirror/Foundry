/-
F1 square — v0.18.0 stage D, brick 1: the CASTELNUOVO–SEVERI BRIDGE at the lattice level —
the function-field model of "Hodge index ⟹ RH" as a genuine derivation, not governor
arithmetic.

Companion §0.3 / §9.1 / ROADMAP stage D. Weil's proof of RH-for-curves runs the Hodge index
property on the Néron–Severi lattice of `C × C` against the graph of Frobenius. This module
mechanizes that run COMPLETELY for the template case (`E × E`, genus 1 — the §2.2 sourced
lattice extended by the Frobenius graph):

  • The lattice: classes `h·F_h + v·F_v + d·Δ + g·Γ` with the standard sourced/derived
    intersection numbers over `𝔽_q` — `F_h² = F_v² = 0`, `F_h·F_v = 1`, `Δ·F = Γ·F_h = 1`,
    `Γ·F_v = q` (Frobenius has bidegree `(1, q)`), `Δ² = Γ² = 0` (genus 1, adjunction), and
    the TRACE DATUM `Δ·Γ = q + 1 − a` (the Lefschetz fixed-point count `#E(𝔽_q)`).
  • The primitive projection: for `D = x·Δ + y·Γ`, the class
    `D° = D − (D·F_v)·F_h − (D·F_h)·F_v` is orthogonal to both rulings
    (`primDG_perp_h/v`) — the projection to the primitive complement of the ample cone.
  • THE COMPUTATION (`primDG_sq`): `D°² = −2·(x² + a·xy + q·y²)` — the Hodge-index
    quadratic form IS the binary quadratic form `x² + axy + qy²` of discriminant `a² − 4q`.
  • THE BRIDGE (`ff_hodge_iff_hasse`): negativity of `D°²` for ALL `x, y`
    ⟺ `a² ≤ 4q` — Hodge-index negativity on the primitive `{Δ, Γ}`-span is EXACTLY the
    Hasse bound (`4(x² + axy + qy²) = (2x + ay)² + (4q − a²)y²`), i.e. RH for the curve.
    Tied to the v0.1.0 governor (`ff_hodge_iff_hodgeType`): `Mechanism.hodgeType` is now a
    DERIVED consequence of lattice positivity, closing the §0.3 statement "the mechanism is
    not the gap" as a theorem.

WHY THIS IS STAGE-D SUBSTRATE: the v0.18.0 bridge states `HodgeIndex(spectral 𝕊) ⟺ Li
positivity`. Its classical anchor is precisely this function-field model — where the trace
datum `Δ·Γ = q+1−a` sits INSIDE the lattice and positivity forces the spectral bound. On
canonical `𝕊` the coarse lattice is pencil-blind (`Square.square_hodge_pencil_blind`,
`Δ·Γ_n = 0`): the trace datum is what the spectral (`H¹`-bearing) enrichment must carry, and
THIS module is the exact shape of what carrying it buys. RH itself stays OPEN.
