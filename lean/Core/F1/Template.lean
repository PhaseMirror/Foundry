F1 square — the product-of-curves intersection-form TEMPLATE (a UOR-style realization).

Companion §2.2 / §0.3 / §1.4. Canonical form: the Néron–Severi lattice of a product of
(elliptic) curves, basis `{E₁, E₂, E₃}` with `E₁·E₂ = 1`, `E₁² = E₂² = 0`, `E₃² = −2`
(sourced: Pietromonaco, arXiv 1905.07085 — the `NS(E×E)` survey; the underlying DT
computation is Bryan, arXiv 1902.08695. See the companion §2.1 citation verification).
Invariants proved here — pure Lean 4, no Mathlib,
no `sorry`:
  • the pairing is symmetric;
  • the sourced intersection numbers (`E₁·E₂ = 1`, `E₃² = −2`);
  • the ample class `H = E₁ + E₂` has `H² = 2 > 0` (the projectivity/Kähler precondition, §1.4);
  • `H^⊥ = span{E₁−E₂, E₃}`, on which the form is `diag(−2, −2)`: negative-semidefinite AND
    nondegenerate (`pair v v = 0 ↔ v = 0`) — i.e. NEGATIVE-DEFINITE.
Together these are the Hodge type `(1, 2)` decomposition (one positive line `H`, a
negative-definite primitive plane `H^⊥`).

Scope (honest): this is the TEMPLATE the concrete 𝔽₁ square must match (§2.2 caveat); it is
[CLASSICAL] on a genuine product surface over a field, NOT a construction of the square. The
intersection numbers are the sourced ones, derived/checked — never hand-tuned (the program's
"declarative discipline").
