F1 square — v0.19.0 stage E, the closure push: **THE GENUINE ARCHIMEDEAN TREND, ALL `n`** —
the archimedean side of the crux as a single constructed object.

THE OBJECT. The Bombieri–Lagarias archimedean part has the exact general-`n` closed form
[CLASSICAL, deep-research-verified against the primary PDFs — Voros, *Math. Phys. Anal.
Geom.* 9 (2006), eqs. 20–21; Coffey, arXiv math-ph/0505052, Thm 1; Lagarias, *Ann. Inst.
Fourier* 57 (2007), eq. (4.11) with the pole term folded in]:

    `λₙ^{∞} = 1 − (n/2)(γ + log 4π) + Σ_{j=2}^n (−1)ʲ C(n,j) (1 − 2^{−j}) ζ(j)`.

EVERY ingredient is already built in this substrate: `γ` (`Rgamma_h`, v0.14.0), `log 4π`
(`Rlog4pic`, v0.14.0), `ζ(j)` for every `j ≥ 2` (`zeta`, v0.10.0), binomials (`choose`).
So the WHOLE archimedean side of the crux — for every `n` at once, one definition, no
enumeration — is constructible today, and here it is: `genuineArchSeq`.

THE CONSISTENCY THEOREMS (the guards): at the two independently-built slices the
construction agrees, as a theorem, with the v0.15.3/v0.18.0 archimedean parts —
`genuineArch_one : genuineArchSeq 1 ≈ Rlambda1_arch` and
`genuineArch_two : genuineArchSeq 2 ≈ Rlambda2_arch`. These are real reconciliations of
two distinct constructions (the closed-form instance vs the hand-assembled slices), not
restatements — exactly the §2.2 self-check discipline applied to the trend.

WHAT THIS CHANGES (and what it does not). With the trend constructed, the crux's open
content contracts to the ARITHMETIC side alone: through the trace and the dominance face
(`Square.crux_vs_constructed_trend`), the crux is now "the genuine arithmetic part admits
one bound strictly below THIS BUILT SEQUENCE". The identification of `genuineArchSeq` with
the archimedean side of the genuine ζ explicit formula is [CLASSICAL] (the closed form
above); its positivity/growth — `(n/2)log n + cn + O(1)`, `c = (γ−1−log 2π)/2`,
unconditional (Lagarias Thm 5.1) — is sourced, not mechanized. NOTHING here touches
positivity of the genuine `λₙ`: the crux stays open; the fields stay `none`.
