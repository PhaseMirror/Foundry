F1 square — v0.19.0 (the genuine-pairing arc), brick W3b: **α(0) > 0 — Burnol's
window-center positivity certificate, computed.**

THE CERTIFICATE. Burnol's spectral multiplier for the prime-free window
(arXiv math/0101068; deep-research-verified) is
    `α(τ) = 8√2·cos(τ·log 2)/(1 + 4τ²) + h₊(τ)`,   `h₊(τ) = −log π + Re ψ(1/4 + iτ/2)`,
and `Z(g ⋆ g^τ) = ∫ α(τ)·|ĝ(s)|² dτ/2π ≥ 0`. The BARE `α` is NOT pointwise non-negative —
it is indefinite (`DigammaWindow`); windowed positivity is recovered on the RESTRICTED
test class via Burnol's `A_ε·cos(ετ)` correction (or the Connes–Consani Sonine-space
projection, *Selecta Math.* 27 (2021)), NOT by pointwise `α ≥ 0`. At the window CENTER
`τ = 0`:
    `α(0) = 8√2 − log π + ψ(1/4)`,
every term now built: `√2 = exp(½·log 2)` (`RrpowPos`, `≥ 1` since `log 2 ≥ 0`),
`log π` (`Rlogπc`, `≤ 115/100`), and `ψ(1/4)` (`psiQuarter`, `≥ −432/100`, brick W3a).

THE COMPUTED VALUE. `burnolAlphaZero_pos : Pos burnolAlphaZero` — `α(0) > 0` (true value
`≈ 5.94`), certified from the wide margin `8·1 − 1.15 − 4.32 = 2.53 > 0` (using only
`√2 ≥ 1`). This is the multiplier's value at the center of the prime-free window made an
axiom-clean theorem — the constructive footprint of the unconditional window positivity,
evaluated where it is computable.

THE HONEST BOUNDARY (the standing discipline). `α(0) > 0` is the multiplier at ONE point
— EVIDENCE for `α ≥ 0` (the windowed positivity), exactly as `weilPrime_demo` and the
certified `λ`-slices are evidence: it is not the universal `α(τ) ≥ 0 ∀τ` (which needs the
complex-digamma real part and its uniform-in-τ bound, beyond any finite check), still less
RH (the window excludes every prime). Nothing here asserts the universal; the crux fields
stay `none`.
